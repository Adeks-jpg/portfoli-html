            <p>Over the past decade, JavaScript has evolved from a simple scripting language for adding small interactive features to websites into a cornerstone of modern web development. 
            With the introduction of powerful frameworks like React, Vue, and Angular, developers can now build dynamic, scalable, and highly interactive applications that run seamlessly across devices.</p>

            <p>The popularity of these frameworks is not without reason. They offer a range of benefits including improved development speed, better maintainability, and a vibrant ecosystem of libraries and tools. 
            In this post, we will explore the growth of JavaScript frameworks, their advantages, and why they have become indispensable for developers worldwide.</p>

            <h2>Why Frameworks Matter</h2>
            <p>Before the era of frameworks, developers had to write large amounts of vanilla JavaScript to handle even simple user interactions. This often led to messy, repetitive code that was hard to maintain. 
            Frameworks introduced a structured approach to building web applications, enforcing best practices, and simplifying common tasks such as DOM manipulation, state management, and routing.</p>

            <h2>React: The Component Revolution</h2>
            <p>React, developed by Facebook, popularized the concept of component-based architecture. Instead of writing long procedural scripts, developers break the UI into reusable pieces. 
            Each component manages its own state and logic, making the application more predictable and easier to debug.</p>

            <p>For example, a simple React component might look like this:</p>

            <pre><code>
import React from 'react';

function Greeting({ name }) {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

export default Greeting;
            </code></pre>

            <h2>Vue: The Progressive Framework</h2>
            <p>Vue offers a gentle learning curve, making it ideal for beginners while still being powerful enough for large-scale applications. 
            It combines the best ideas from Angular and React, providing a template-based syntax along with reactive state management.</p>

            <h2>Angular: The Full-Fledged Solution</h2>
            <p>Angular, maintained by Google, is a complete front-end framework with built-in solutions for routing, form handling, and HTTP requests. 
            While it has a steeper learning curve, it excels in enterprise environments where large, complex applications need to be maintained over time.</p>

            <h2>The Future of JavaScript Frameworks</h2>
            <p>The future of JavaScript frameworks looks promising, with innovations like server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), and new runtimes like Deno and Bun changing how we build for the web. 
            Frameworks will likely continue to evolve to support these trends, making web development faster and more efficient than ever before.</p>

            <p>Whether you choose React, Vue, Angular, or any other framework, the key takeaway is that mastering at least one of them will significantly enhance your skills as a modern web developer.</p>
